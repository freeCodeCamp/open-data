We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

There are several things you can do to make the code more elegant.

- You dont need the helper function. 
Here is a little peak on how to achieve that
```
function steamroller(arr, newArr)
```
- Instead of doing if not, turn the if-statement around to make the block more understandable
```
if (Array.isArray(value))
    helper(value)
else
   newArray.push(value)
```
"
