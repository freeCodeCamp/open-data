Been doing some FCC stuff in earnest for a little over a month now and have been coding since the Summer in my free time when I'm not working. Did a paid program part-time but it was RoR based and I really am enjoying and preferring JavaScript

Wednesdays and Fridays work for me, although this last week of the year I'm gonna be kinda holidayish, so let's set it up for the first friday of new year

5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-12-23T00:27:50.876Z	55382fea15522ed4b3df630c	wgwz	585c6f86c02c1a3959a10a12	@jenkynolasco11 cool. let's get something in the works then. what's your schedule like? probably a friday would work for me.

If you are going to work on the intermediate projects in between, I have found a short free course on Udactiy that will make working with the APIs much more understandable and will make it quicker to complete the projects! I didnt find the video until after, and they took me so long...

There are a number of things you can do but I'd start by exploring either setting a max-width attribute on the paragraph parent or specializing the paragraph with a class that sets the max-width on the paragraph. Can you put your project on Codepen or similar so the community can recommend the better approach?

Some also ask for knowledge of front end frameworks, such as angular/react, bootstrap, etc... At least for frontend for now... Some also ask for design tools knowledge, such as photoshop/illustrator...

And now I'm moving on to do the portfolio project, which is right after the tribute one. But I haven't even learned how to make buttons work a certain way when you press them in previous lessons. So, additionally should I take Codeacadmy's courses on html/css before I begin this project ?

Does anyone have an opinion on whether or not PHP is worth learning in 2016? Any experience you have? I'm interested in getting into building for CMS (wordpress).

I see what you're saying about IoT, I'm thinking of connecting some lights and camera inside my home for the days I'm away - terrible if a hacker gained access to them!

5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-10-12T14:16:14.082Z	563d1b0616b6c7089cb9c469	Jean13	57fe45aed6251fd126b1a277	@bresson Nice. Well, good fit or not, as long as you enjoy it and you focus on getting good at it that's all that matters, right? I actually come from a finance background. I felt that with the rate that IoT is going, security work will become much more important and exciting, so I dove right into it. Assembly is really a must for discovering vulnerabilities; kind of like what JS is to web development.

There are few domains I'd love to explore such as data mining and visualization but not sure if it will be a good fit with my current skill set. Were you a CS major? security and assembly doesn't sound easy ....

Lord knows I need some published projects to add to my resume :P And for now, I want to clean up some minor CSS bugs I occasionally see, minifying everything, and have a clean release on both Chrome and FF. (Right now, there are still some console.log statements in there...).Then, hopefully, I'll get some good feedback for more feature implementations, and maybe make a more robust version.

They even linked me to the knowledgebase article on efficient DOM building.
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T15:03:55.576Z	558e0ef215522ed4b3e2e54b	AryanJ-NYC	57d966dbaabc89857fa0e85e	Wow. So the reviewers actually helped with specific problems (I thought they would've just denied it with a standard rejection reason / rejection code).
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T15:02:30.905Z	5637cf1e16b6c7089cb93929	gbhojraj	57d9668634eaa30e4875ceb1	My biggest coding error was abusing the innerHTML method. It made it really easy to organize and visualize the HTML I was inserting, but the reviewers at Mozilla pointed out that it was more inefficient, and required more work to make sure the dynamic content was sanitized.
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T15:00:47.350Z	558e0ef215522ed4b3e2e54b	AryanJ-NYC	57d9661fc8af41d45f158323	Such as?

5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T14:59:39.206Z	5637cf1e16b6c7089cb93929	gbhojraj	57d965db27a8458f7f152841	There were some features that I considered, like having the saved data hidden behind a password-protected Settings page, that I decided were not worthwhile to implement.
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T14:58:11.818Z	5637cf1e16b6c7089cb93929	gbhojraj	57d9658318291e10486f664a	The biggest concern I had was making the addon as lightweight as possible. My girlfriend runs really slow laptops, so I wanted the extension to be something that would has as minimal an impact as possible.
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T14:56:42.984Z	5637cf1e16b6c7089cb93929	gbhojraj	57d9652afa660dd95fdd0510	Yeah, a fair bit of reading up on how to make an addon.  This was my first addon project.  It was easier to get started now that WebExtensions is the standard solution for cross-browser addons.  I found that Mozilla's documentation for WebExtensions were much less intimidating than Chrome's, which is why the first release is just on Firefox.
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T14:55:39.205Z	558e0ef215522ed4b3e2e54b	AryanJ-NYC	57d964ebaabc89857fa0e080	So you just started coding a JS script that saved data? Any prep work before getting to the nitty gritty?
5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-14T14:53:54.237Z	5637cf1e16b6c7089cb93929	gbhojraj	57d96482c8af41d45f157bbe	"Thanks Aryan! I got the idea when both my girlfriend and I lost our responses on an online survey, because they asked for essays and they timed out before we submitted them.  I did a search for extensions that saved forms, but the top two addons I found were ""intentional saves"", not autosaves, and that didn't help me, because if I even thought I might lose the data, I would just Ctrl+C it in case (I have a habit of it)."

5593982115522ed4b3e3263f	FreeCodeCamp/NewYorkCity	2016-09-08T02:12:12.303Z	551eec6415522ed4b3de52a8	hnry	57d0c8fc89655972304bc6f7	well jade was created by the same person who made express, and back then there was no angular / react

I was trying to think of some reason why it'd be better/more secure to template on the backend rather than frontend, but anything I can think of can be solved with fixing the API.

There are many consulting shops that just spray out messages to the world looking for candidates

Likewise with SEO bots and meta tags.

Ruby on rails is more similar to django (another python web framework). They spew out lots of boiler plate and defaults. Flask is totally minimal. You need to do all of the work. But it leads to an end result you can totally understand all the way throughout the life cycle. It runs some sites apis that handle billions of requests per day. The default server is for development tho.

From that same author, is a newer version of that blog series in book format: http://flaskbook.com/

Here are the docs for Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/ 

I've personally put some stuff into the tutorial there. The documentation is extensive, and honestly, I've learned most of what I know about the web around the Flask community.

For API's front end is normally not needed, I did add a basic one explaining the app though but basically the only one actually requiring a front end is the file one for which I'm pushing to have it moved to the full stack as the first project as it is not really an api and it required basically both fron and backend.

However, I found resources easily and after completing the microservices I made my own fullstack app. What I was mossing was a library for the front end and since we ditched angular I have postponed the synamic web apps for when i get good with react for which I could not find a good resource, and then onnt he first attempt I had to learn **JSX**, **webpack or babelify**, **react**, then later I had to add **ES6** and now **Redux, React-Redux, React-Router** and optionally react-native.

D3 and React were both powerful and relatively easy to pick up. i think FCC did a great job with the order of the projects in both sections, it goes from simple to complex, yet the increase in complexity between each project is just right. still, i wish they at least linked to some tutorials

Would you recommend learning clojurescript without starting in clojure first? I'm still a newbie with functional programming but have a good fix on the major concepts

the data is a javascript object (json) so you just access the data like a normal object like `data.something.blah`"

It has nothing to do with getting the code wrong (because it wasn't trust me), but it had to do with a bug on the website or that the website can't handle the amount of traffic it is getting. I had similar issues with their third party courses a year ago, and now the issue is with their own. Great concept but terrible user experience.  My interest is more in helping out not for profits because I ended up taking courses elsewhere but thought it would be cool to check out how they have progressed.  Can't determine that yet since I haven't been able to get anywhere significant!

When is the next Coffee & Code? Really want to start attending some of these this year

Rafase282 Jan 04 13:21
I'm applying for jobs liek crazy
3 years or under, with at least 75% of the skills listed and I send a resume
not my fault if they dont ask for realistic stuff right?

fidelscodes Jan 04 13:23
lol
I'm sure once you get into the interview and they see what you know/can do, some of the stuff they ask for won't matter
I'm not even close to being employable but when I feel I'm at a level where I am, I will be sending out resumes to pretty much any place I'm interested in working in. Regardless of their unrealistic demands.

Rafase282 Jan 04 14:32
yup

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

Is there a point where you might be employable before that? What is the 1600 hours based on? Cause it's a bit daunting to know to finish everything it will take the equivalent of 66 24 hours periods... When naturally even at 3 hours a day it would take 200 days to finish.

Do you want to build high end video games or enterprise business applications or work for google then yea sure you may need something like that. But by the time you graduate you will have spent $100k+ vs a self taught developer in that same amount of time you were in school they can make $100k.

Can't give you any advice on jobs though since I'm in highschool, maybe someone else can respond.

Looks like a great portion of people like Midtown. Though if you want to go for smaller groups, you can see the range of responses there :-)

My motivation degrades as the day goes on unless I know I'll be in a forced environment later, which is why I desperately need another masochist/burgeoning coder to work with.

I'm flexible most days, and would really like to find a study buddy/group. Because when I try to program alone, suddenly lolcats is way more interesting than staring at my own horrific code.

I think Mark Myers really gets it in terms of the pace and making things bite-size and repeating them in different ways and testing them in different ways. I always take a deep breath before the speed tests. But basically he keeps those towards the end and they're mostly not *that* hard, but challenging enough. (But now I'mma starting over formally on @FreeCodeCamp!).
