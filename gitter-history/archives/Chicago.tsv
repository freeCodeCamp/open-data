I am working on a little challenge as a first time playing in Ruby. The exercise is such that the program needs to ask the user 5 times in a row to enter a word by saying ""Please enter a word"". Each time the user enters a random word and once the user enters 5 words one after the other, the program says ""Here are your words"" and lists them alphabetically and each word alternating uppercase and lower case like so, WORD A, word b, WORD C, word d, WORD E. Although the exercise specifies creating a program with 5 words, I need to write it in such a way that I need it to handle 500 words, I can do so with making only 1 simple change. I am also not to use the each_with_index method. So far, I have this for my code and it is running correctly, but the only thing I can't figure out is the alternating upcase and downcase. Please help me figure it out:
words = []
5.times do
    puts ""Please enter a word""
    words<<gets.chomp
end
puts ""Here are your words:""
puts words.sort"

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Hoping to learn on a structured but relaxed pace, my biggest issue's been motivating myself and adhering to some structure after work and on weekends.

The Spoke and Bird is pretty much my second office. You can't miss me. I have bright red Beats earphones and often have a confused look on my face trying to complete the FCC lessons. Haha. Say hello if I'm there. It would be great to connect with other S Loop FCC'ers.

My original background is in Photography and have worked in that industry for many years, so I would one day love to have a side business building websites for photographers. I am such a newbie....I had to look up Digital Design to see what you meant exactly and that sounds pretty fun too. So I am terrible at answering your question because I guess I just am not totally sure. :)

As in, are you looking to tackle more the UI/UX side of things or are you looking for classes geared toward digital design?

I am working on a little challenge as a first time playing in Ruby. The exercise is such that the program needs to ask the user 5 times in a row to enter a word by saying ""Please enter a word"". Each time the user enters a random word and once the user enters 5 words one after the other, the program says ""Here are your words"" and lists them alphabetically and each word alternating uppercase and lower case like so, WORD A, word b, WORD C, word d, WORD E. Although the exercise specifies creating a program with 5 words, I need to write it in such a way that I need it to handle 500 words, I can do so with making only 1 simple change. I am also not to use the each_with_index method. So far, I have this for my code and it is running correctly, but the only thing I can't figure out is the alternating upcase and downcase. Please help me figure it out:
words = []
5.times do
    puts ""Please enter a word""
    words<<gets.chomp
end
puts ""Here are your words:""
puts words.sort"

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

My original background is in Photography and have worked in that industry for many years, so I would one day love to have a side business building websites for photographers. I am such a newbie....I had to look up Digital Design to see what you meant exactly and that sounds pretty fun too. So I am terrible at answering your question because I guess I just am not totally sure. :)

As in, are you looking to tackle more the UI/UX side of things or are you looking for classes geared toward digital design?
